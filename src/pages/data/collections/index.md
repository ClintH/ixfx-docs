[API Docs: Collections module](https://clinth.github.io/ixfx/modules/Collections.html)

* [Arrays](../arrays/) - Arrays are the basic way for keeping a list of data
* [Stack](./stack/) - Keep track of items like a stack of plates. Most recent gets added to the top, and you can only take the most recent from the top.
* [Queue](./queue/) - Keep track of items like a bakery queue. Most recent is added to the back of the queue, and you can only take from the front of the queue (ie the oldest)

Patterns
* [Process a queue or stack of items](../process-set/)
