* [Array](../arrays/) - Arrays are the basic way for keeping a list of data
* [Stack](./stack/) - Keep track of items like a stack of plates. Most recent gets added to the top, and you can only take the most recent from the top.
* [Queue](./queue/) - Keep track of items like a bakery queue. Most recent is added to the back of the queue, and you can only take from the front of the queue (ie the oldest)
* [Set](./set/) - Sets keep track of unique items.
* [Map](./map/) - Keeps track of key-value pairs.
* [Expiring Map](./expiringMap/) - A forgetful map.

Patterns
* [Process a queue or stack of items](../process-set/)
